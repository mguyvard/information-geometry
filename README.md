# information-geometry
Originally, the idea was to write a general overview with a few non-trivial proofs of some standard theorems of the burgeoning mathematical field Information Geometry. But faced with the difficulty of the task and the prior knowledge necessary (which is huge, by the way), we had no choice other than to be more modest. So we ended up writing a very accessible introduction to the main concepts of the field with some examples along the way. I intend to enrich and polish it as my knowledge about the field progresses.
